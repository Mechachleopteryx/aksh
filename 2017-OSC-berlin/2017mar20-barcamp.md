# Reproducibility of Research Data & its Management
I would like to propose a discussion space on Reproducibility of Research Data & the infrastructure for the management of Research Data at Universities. This would encompass the spectrum of open tools, the infrastructure challenges in handling multiple research fields (ex. psychology, biology, chemistry, etc..). The biggest challenge is teaching researchers to use Free/Libre tools - How can we encourae/educate researchers to use Libre software and open their research? Vid_Ayer @svaksha 


### Data 
+ Data Management organisation is hard
- would like to find structure in data.
- DMP 
- go one step down and where is this data coming from ? 
- We check the lab note book page.
- DAKN Data Archiving and Management services can be queried and requested to help.
- E-Science tage.
- Finding relationships with the data.


### File formats
+ Participant recalled their usage of proprietary software that outputs a csv file, stored somewhere as raw data, if more data has to be compared they need the proprietary software to produce more data that no one looks at later.
+ Open Knowledge (Ireland) is trying to solve the data management plan.

### Git 
+ Archiving is useful.
+ Git is used as a tool for teaching scientists to store their work.
+ Git vs. Mercurial debate.
+ version control is very useful
+ non-digital, git makes it efficient


### Opinions on research data from different fields 
+ more difference to reproduce
+ not possible to fully automate.
+ how can an outsider asses?
+ can rely if the system is well implemented.
+ need to talk to the expert.
+ dont know the correct result 
+ validation is important.
+ madagascar package - lib of scripts - workflow engine.
+ C and scots - sergio.

### Software
+ Matlab had an issue with versions, giving different results.
+ old version of matlab was needed.
+ found out the Reproducibility problem later.

### Software carpentry
+ humboldt centers - short workshop
+ people reflected on SWC in a very positive way.
+ Like the teaching material.

## Research data artefacts
+ data about documentations of the analysis
+ metadata
+ fair data principles
+ archiving  


### Why Reproducibility
+ Documentation
+ former postdoc, need to rework the data
+ OpenCon satellite sessions
+ script is not enough, if something fails then its not enough to have the script.
+ bad code is sometimes better than good code.
+ standard methods can be reproduced.
+ reproduce a famous experiment so that student learns and we can learn why it was so.
    * step-1: same data, same tools, same results
    * step-2: same data, tools, build on old data
+ Requirements Engg is important.
+ standards are important - must be adhered to in differenct fields
