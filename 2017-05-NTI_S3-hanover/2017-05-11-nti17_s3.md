# 09:00 - 11:00 Session 4: Impact and sustainability through accessible, reusable and open software, Moderator: Timo Borst (German National Library of Economics (ZBW), Germany)

#  09:00 - 09:30 BigDataEurope - The collaborative creation of an open software platform for researchers addressing Europe's societal challenges, Sören Auer (University of Bonn / Fraunhofer IAIS, Germany) [ask for slides]
+ http://big-data-europe.eu

### Three 'V' of bigData:  
+ Volume : 
+ Variety : biggest challenge 
+ Velocity : realtime data.

### Data Value Chain Evolution
+ extraction, curation, quality, linking, 
+ cloudera, hortonworks, bigtop, MapR,  etc.. have big biz
+ applications are a 'zoo' of usecases and products: analytics, ML, etc..

### Integrator Platform Arch
+ dockerization
+ key BD platform - supports integrated UI
+ supports semantic layers of data

### Platform Arch
+ can download the platform and deploy it 
+ app layer
+ support layer
+ platform layer
+ data layer
+ semantification layer

### Semantic data lake (Ontario)
+ Sparql query --> decomposing user query : 
+ finding relevant data sources + converting queries
+ metadata
+ database 

### BDE vs. Hadoop distributions
+ more open and runs on all machines

### QA
+ currently no academic collaborators, apache bigtop is a linuy project,
