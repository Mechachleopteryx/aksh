So you want to do open science; now what? Discussion of tools and advice for researchers wanting to make their work more open. 
The idea is for this to result in a manuscript for an actual print journal.
"Everything you always wanted to know about open science but were afraid to ask."

Notes:
Say you and/or your lab group have decided that you want to make your science more open. Where do you start? What tools should you learn first?
Landscape overview of what open science is.  What are components (open data, open access, open source, etc)?
This is the vision -> now, what are the baby steps that people can start making to get towards that?
Possible venues: Frontiers (Steph emailed Sue Silver to ask about her interest in it and also whether we could get open access - she is on the road and says will think about it and respond by 4 Sept), BioScience, something open...
Lay out the scientific process and look at what would constitute open science at that stage.

Powerful argument for Open Science
"Science is based on building on, reusing and openly criticizing the published body of scientific knowledge." http://pantonprinciples.org/#sthash.3p5pZz6C.dpuf 
The Web has become a platform, fundamentally changing the way that we publish and share knowledge. The effectiveness of Science depends on interoperability and worldwide collaboration. 
Groups like Mozilla Science Lab are pushing the entire science community forward through the webification of science.  
"For science to effectively function, and for society to reap the full benefits from scientific endeavors, it is crucial that science data be made open."   http://pantonprinciples.org/#sthash.3p5pZz6C.dpuf 

    Acknowledges contributions - when data are open it's clear who contributed- Especially for ecology if we are moving toward ecology-focused journal

    Reproducibility - lab notebooks can't capture everything that is on a computer

    Transparency of steps and rationale [benefits of forcing us to think through our steps carefully]

    (now more accessible than recent decades)

    Public availability 

    facilitates failure analyses

    openness is a continuum, rather than an all or nothing

    What is the fullest expression of science given available technologies - how do we get there from here

Open science in ecology
[Sarah]
In principle, there is nothing new about open science; the idea that knowledge is best advanced when all observations and methods are available for discussion was shared by the earliest recorded philosophers.  The history of science has been one of increasing dissemination of knowledge, speeding discovery through discussion and collaboration. This exchange accelerated dramatically when local verbal discourse could be supplemented with printed books, and again when shorter papers began to be distributed in regularly issued scientific journals (Atkinson 1999). We are clearly in the midst of the next major step change in scientific progress, in which online tools allow knowledge to be exchanged with volume, variety and velocity that were not possible even a decade ago.
But the practical aspects of scientific openness are inevitably very different for an invisible college that spans the globe and welcomes all comers than for a handful of Western European gentlemen of leisure.  Ironically, the very developments that make modern open science necessary---the accumulation, sharing, and recombination of larger data sets, the computational methods that cannot be adequately tracked in a traditional notebook (Strasser and Hampton 2012)---have also raised a barrier to entry:  the apparent need for fluency in a diverse and ever-evolving array of digital technologies.  Here, we argue that the most important tool for open science is practitioners' mindset:  the belief that openness promotes fairness in attribution, careful attention to each step of experimental design and data analysis, and reproducibility; that open science allows us to maximize the impact and reach of our successes, and to make the most of our failures.  We discuss the ways in which a small and well-established set of digital tools contribute to developing this mindset.
[Steph, Sarah, Jai, Sean]
[space for definitions] - what we mean by 'open' 
[a brief history of sharing - publication -> open science -> next steps - minimize this if risk being inaccurate or smug - an alternate historical box might be a history of GenBank]
[Ted] How much of open science is represented by the different components of openness? Is open science a combination of open data, open code and open access?  I think this would be a good place to explore these ideas of openness and the contributions of each component.
[Erin] Ted, like that point. Matt jones showed a pic at the beginning where Open science was made of open source, open access for journals and open data. I think these three parts are the parts we can discuss further down in the tools/methods. 
[Ted] I think another component of the discussion is does openness require reproducibility? I know that reproducible science doesn't have to be open, but does open science have to be reproducible?
[Erin] I like these five tenants, which include reproducibility and reusability https://storify.com/jhollist/what-is-the-definition-of-open-science
[Ted] Reading through the text I think that there's a certain conflation of 'open' and 'big' or 'open' and 'best practices'.  Open data can be small, and there's a lot of big data sets that are closed.  Even if best practices are implemented, the data can still be closed.  For instance, try and get NutNet data.  It's well managed, but not open.  
[Sarah] Not sure if this does the right thing, just tossing it out:
An open science mindset affects the entire data life-cycle, carrying responsibilities and offering benefits at each stage along the way.  When an experiment is still in the planning stages, a commitment to open research requires us to consider not only how to perform the experiment but also how to capture data and the metadata that will enable others to use it productively.  The same commitment gives us access to a research group far bigger than one lab; experimental designs can be tightened up, better controls and new directions suggested, when inchoate ideas are posted for discussion on blogs and social media.  When data is being collected and organized, a commitment to open science requires explicit documentation of every step and decision along the way; producing such documentation is an exercise in critical thinking, a constant reminder to check our assumptions and clarify our reasoning.  When data is being described and preserved, a commitment to open science requires us to choose methods and repositories that will make our data usable and accessible for years to come, allowing our work to be integrated into the body of knowledge and ensuring that, when we return to a project after a period away, we can pick up where we left off.  When data is being analyzed, a commitment to open science requires us to use reproducible, script-based methods as far as possible, and to share our scripts, not only giving other researchers a tool to use in their own projects but also reducing our work's vulnerability to hard-to-trace errors that creep into GUI-based analyses.  Version control at every stage helps us to keep track of the evolution of our ideas and methods and preserves the long-term integrity of the project even as collaborations form and shift.
Specifics - OK, I'm on board, what should my students learn?
Changes in mindset - key differences that are enabled by technologies
[AFSHIN] We are entering an era of “big data” which the amount of scientific data that is produced every year is increasing significantly. As Hey, Tansley and Tolle [2009] argued we are entering a fourth era of “eScience”. Lack of structure to fully taking advantage of this flow of data is a lost opportunity. There is a keen interest in shifting the paradigm and encourage more scientists to join the “open science” movement. In order to achieve this goal, we need to look at open science as a medium to accelerate the research, encourage collaboration, and pushing the boundaries of science. In this way, every scientist is a member of larger scientific group in which everyone collaborates and benefit from each other resources and expertise to address the more complex research questions which are often impossible to tackle alone. One of the major hurdles for open science is competition with other scientists and current reward system. This needs to be addressed by revising the current system in which intellectual properties and ownership is well recognized beyond traditional publication and citation. The mind set should shift to push the boundaries of science as a group effort and remember the ultimate goal of science is to discover the new horizons. Cultivating this mind set could lead to win situation for all collaborators and more importantly public which most of the time are skeptical about science benefits for them. Another major benefit is to avoid common mistake of “reinventing the wheel”; often we as scientists are unaware of similar research, datasets and results conducted by other researchers in another country or continent especially if published results are in low-impact journals that normally do not show up on our radar. This could be avoided by providing cyber-infrastructure in which all the datasets could be searchable and pave the path to further international collaboration. Therefore both “big labs” and “small-labs” could benefit. Another paradigm shift s
hould focus on the fact that every research will gain more by open science and diversifying collaboration compared to what one group could achieve alone in their lab. [AFSHIN]
 
[AFSHIN] Everyday more journals are required to submit data along with analysis. The open science platform facilitate collaboration in way that every step of data (experimental design, data collection method, QA/QC, analysis and underlying assumptions, interpretation of data) to be documented. This improves the clarity of data for other scientists as well as providing the opportunity to receive extensive feedback from other scientists. Some journals recently started (e.g. ??) the process of posting the paper online to receive feedback from other scientists instead of limiting the feedback to few reviewers. The outcome improved the clarity of the context as well as improving the manuscript. 
Mention paper about not publishing failure: Research showed that so many scientists do not publish “bad results” which is the effect of our current reward system that a scientist only appraised when they achieve “good results”. This needs to be changed to avoid waste of resources and conducting the same research while it also can significantly improve addressing the underlying reasons for failure. Another benefit of open science is that it encourage researches to start using standard structure to archive their data (e.g., Ameriflux, CF convention). [AFSHIN]
Open science, and particularly open data, has gained increasing traction in the scientific community over the past decade[XH1] . We are entering an era of “Big Data” in which the amount of scientific data that is produced every year is increasing significantly. As Hey, Tansley and Tolle [2009] argued we are entering a fourth era of “eScience”. Lack of structure to fully take advantage of this flow of data is a lost opportunity. There is a keen interest in shifting the paradigm and encourage more scientists to join the “open science” movement. In Ecology, the surge in open science participation has been driven by the development of key technologies that have significantly facilitated the sharing and transparency of the data life cycle [XH2] . As open science becomes more prevalent, a fundamental shift in how ecologists engage and interact with science is taking place. In this section, we describe four [XH3] fundamental shifts in mindsets that are essential to the advancement of open science in ecology:
 
1.     Data ownership[XH4] : traditional views on data ownership are such that data are considered proprietary products of the researcher (Sieber 1989). In this conventional schema, the researcher has the power to control the conditions and circumstances in which he/she shares and disseminates data. This viewpoint on data ownership has prevailed because of a variety of reasons such as concerns on being “scooped” should the data be made public, competition with other scientists, the current reward system, lack of proper acknowledgement[XH5] , desire to publish from the dataset throughout one’s career, feelings of ownership because of the financial costs of generating the data, and fear of criticism (Sieber 1989). Under the principles of open science, however, data are generated with the mindset of unfettered public dissemination. This fundamental shift in thinking from “I own the data” to “Open data” is a challenging process but one that is essential to the transparency and reproducibility of the open science framework.
2.     Acceleration in the advancement of science[XH6] : Open science is a medium to accelerate research, encourage collaboration, and push the boundaries of science. In this way, every scientist is a member of a larger scientific group in which individuals collaborate and benefit from one another’s resources and expertise to address more complex research questions that are often impossible to tackle alone. The mind set should shift to push the boundaries of science as a group effort and remember the ultimate goal of science is to discover new horizons[XH7] . Cultivating this mind set could lead to win-win situations for all collaborators and more importantly the general public whom have expressed skepticism over the societal benefits of scientific research. Another major benefit is to avoid the common mistake of “reinventing the wheel.” Research has shown that many scientists do not publish “bad results” which is the effect of the current reward system in which scientists are only praised when they achieve “good results[XH8] ”. This needs to be changed to avoid waste of resources and conducting the same research while it also can significantly improve addressing the underlying reasons for failure. Another benefit of open science is that it encourage researches to start using standard structure to archive their data (e.g., Ameriflux, CF convention). As scientists, we are often unaware of similar research, datasets and results conducted by other researchers especially if published results are in low-impact [XH9] journals that do not normally show up on our radar. This could be avoided by providing cyber-infrastructure in which all the datasets are searchable and pave the path to further international collaboration. This could facilitate researchers in both “big labs” and “small-labs” to start using standard structure to archive their data (e.g., Ameriflux, CF convention) and foster more diverse collaboration. 
3.     Complete transparency in the data life cycle: The rise of the Internet and the World Wide Web combined with the development of several key technologies [XH10] have enabled ecologists to make every section of the data life cycle public and transparent. Science has always been intended to be “open science” (David 2004), but the idea and implementation of open science has only occurred recently because this is the first time that technological advancement has caught up to facilitate open transparency and reproducibility. The[XH11]  idea of open science actually began with the establishment of the first academic journal, the Royal Society, in 1660 as a platform for scientists to openly share their results and ideas (David 2004). [XH12] Reproducibility and transparency has long been central to the development, advancement, and foundation of science. Scientists publish their methodology with reproducibility by others in mind. Present cyber-infrastructures have advanced enough such that scientists can take the next step in transparency and reproducibility by ensuring open access to every stage of the scientific process. Increasingly, journals are requiring researchers to submit data along with their manuscript. The open science platform facilitates collaboration in a way that every step of the data life cycle (experimental design, data collection method, QA/QC, analysis and underlying assumptions, interpretation of data) is documented. This improves the clarity of the data and research process for other scientists as well as provides the opportunity to receive extensive feedback from the rest of the scientific community. Some journals recently started (e.g. ??) the process of posting manuscripts online to provide authors feedback by other scientists instead of limiting the feedback to peer-reviewers. Transparency in the data life cycle can improve the quality of clarity as well as the manuscript. [XH13] 
4.     Acceptance of critique (openness to “failure”): We learn as graduate students to accept constructive criticism from our advisors, peers, committee members, and senior faculty but the underlying fear of being “looked down upon” for our ideas or for being “wrong” never goes away. We as scientists understand that failure is a normal part of the scientific process but failure in private and failure in public are as different as night and day. The shift from publishing one’s results to making every key step of the data life cycle transparent speaks to the core of our fears as scientists. Viewing increased transparency as constructive feedback opportunities to improve our ability to do science rather than public moments of failure is a fundamental step towards building an open science community.

 [XH2]see some box with timeline of these key technologies?—Internet, Dropbox, Google Docs, Github, R, etc.
 [XH3]4? Maybe some other number—depending on how many we end up talking about at the end.
 [XH4]Should we talk about “degree” of openness?
 [XH5]Or “receiving credit” for the data
 [XH6]Instead of viewing others as competitors in publishing an idea, understanding that they are part of your larger research group. Science isn’t the individual. It’s about advancing the science, not your own ego/career as a scientist.

    Your research group is bigger than your lab

    [Joe] In the past, academic conferences were one of the only forums for 'confer'ring with research peers. The internet has removed this barrier to scientific communicaiton.

    [Joe] Focus should be on "What can I do to contribute to my research group/field?" and not on "How can I raise the profile of my research lab?"

    [Joe] The difference is between science-driven science and career-driven science. 

    Explicit capture of every key step and decision

    [Joe] Shift away from the mindset of "I'll tell you what's important for you to know about in my methods section, just trust me."

    [Joe] Initially overlooked steps and seemingly minor decisions can turn out to have important consequences. If these steps and decisions are not recorded and shared, there is little chance of others discovering the importance of specific research details.

    Openness to feedback from other colleagues (openness to "failure")

    [Joe] Scientists make make mistakes. There is no scientific benefit to pretending mistakes don't happen and presenting research as if it were a flawless process.

    You don't "own" the data

    [Joe] Just as the results of experiments should be repeatable, the results of analyses should also be repeatable. This can't be evaluated unless others can access and re-analyze your data.

    [Ideas - do you "own" the idea?]

    [Joe] Darwin and Wallace example demonstrates some of the positive and negative aspects of being more open about ideas:

    Darwin's initial reluctance to be open about his natural selection ideas delayed a major advance in the field of biology by 20 years. This suggests that science is best served by increased openness in sharing ideas.

    Wallace's openness with Darwin about his independently conceived unpublished ideas concerning natural selection led Darwin to quickly publish his own findings on natural selection, essentially "scooping" Wallace. This is an example of the real potential for negative personal consequences that can arise from increased openness in sharing ideas.

    It is important to note that Wallace did receive some credit for his ideas and his role in the development of the theory of natural selection, and co-authored the initial paper on the subject with Darwin.

    We all work more quickly when our research group grows - we want to stand on the shoulders of giants

    Increased value with increased use for both software and data

    Trust your 'users'

    Right to remix/hackability 

[Joe, Afshin, Shirley]
Specific Steps New Students/Practitioners Can Focus on:

    become familiar with software that facilitates documenting steps in research process, versioning of data/software

    have a more explicit focus on data lifecycle

    Build tools that are open 

Open-Source Tools and Approaches
[Bill developed a separate table that lists stage of the data life cycle (from plan to anlayze and all steps in between), highlights one or more open source tools for each stage, briefly describes the tool, and includes a url to the tool web site Table emailed to Stephanie on September 3]
[Bill] A variety of free and open source tools can be used to support open science.  Table 1 highlights some widely used tools that support each element of the data life cycle as described by Strasser et al., 2011.  Open science and, in particular, reproducibility require that good practices be followed throughout each step of the data life cycle as descrbed below:
1.  Plan. Data management plans should fully document how you will collect, organize, manage, analyze and disseminate your data, including any who will be responsible for different activities and how the activities will be funded. 
some more possible text:  

    Refer to best practices guides for more help and insight here, 

    DataONE data management primer - Best Practices Primer

    ESIP - http://commons.esipfed.org/datamanagementshortcourse

    IEDA - http://www.iedadata.org/services

2.  Collect and Organize.  Data should ideally be organized using non-proprietary software such as spreadsheets or, ideally, database management systems that promote or enforce good practices (e.g., data typing, structrured data entry forms). Importantly, community standards for formatting and naming conventions should be employed if available.
3.  Quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC).  Data quality depends upon having clear and well-defined approaches to data capture that can be verified by others. Ideally, data are routinely quality checked and visualized.  Moreover, everyone on the project team should be engaged in QA/QC activities.
4.  Describe.  Data are of little or no use unless every aspect of the data are well documented (e.g., how, where, when, and why were the data collected?; who collected, managed and analyzed the data; how were the data processed, analyzed, stored, and disseminated?; what QA/QC procedures were employed). Importantly, metadata standards should be adopted and metadata creators should err on the side of providing too much documentation.
5.  Preserve.  Open science requires that others be able to access the data over time.  Trusted, public digital repositories (such as Dryad) are preferred over personal websites or "hidden" institutional repositories as a means for preserving data for years to decades; most trusted repositories have established clear protocols and guidelines that, when followed, promote data longevity, discovry and reuse.
6.  Discover.  Following good data preservation practices and associating data with comprehensive metadata, including keywords, enables search tools to more precisely identify and evaluate the data that prospective users may need.
7.  Integrate.  New knowledge often depends upon being able to integrate different types of data into a synthethic database or analytical workflow (e.g., biodiversity studies that include soil, climate, and other types of data).  Such integration is feasible when data tables include standardized relational keys such as date, location, taxon, and other commonly employed descriptors of the observations 
8.  Analzye and visualize.  Open science is promoted when individuals can access, view, and reproduce analyses and visualizations.  Increasingly workflow solutions such as VisTrails, which can automatically track data provenance and replicate complex analytical steps, are being used to support data and analytical reproducibility.

    Adopt Modularity and web service oriented approaches

    Scripting everything possible (R, python, or others) and publishing those scripts

    [Kara]  A key facet of open science is clear documentation of the steps taken  in an analysis. One of the most important things you can do to make your  work more open (and more reproducible) is to transition from  point-and-click analytical tools to scripted ones like R or Python.  These tools can be used to import your raw, uncleaned data, clean it,  analyze it, and produce figures or even final manuscripts. Publishing  your code is essential to open science.

    Version control and ability to fork 

    Scientific workflows to document provenance (Kepler, Viztrails, Sumatra)

[Kara, Luke, Chris, Bill, Corinna, Erin]
Collaborative R&D (Open Source)
[Would be good to have some examples of collaborative, open ecology]

    Adopt a community approach where possible

    clearly identify collaborators and funders

    Electronic notebooks (etherpad, google docs, Evernote, wikis, IPython/Rmd)) - networks (see Brian Glanz of open science federation) Carl Boettiger's lab notebook is also worth looking at, and was featured in a piece in Science about open notebooks: http://www.sciencemag.org/site/products/lst_20140725.xhtml

    Social networking tools; globally facing as well as internally/lab group facing (PLOS Biology article last year on [twitter](http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001535)

    Shiffman paper on Twitter and science: http://rjd.miami.edu/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/Darling-Shiffman-2013.pdf       Marine Biologist tweeting = open source got him new figures from the community at large

Open Access for Publications

    Publish preprints

    [Kara] As you wrap up your manuscripts consider posting preprints, e.g. on arXiv, FigShare, or PeerJ. Desjardins-Proulx et al. (2013 http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pbio.1001563 ) highlighted several arguments in favor of posting preprints, including the ability to quickly work to a broad audience; immediate visibility of that work, which can be important for early career scientists; the opportunity for feedback from a broad community of researchers, not just the formal peer reviewers; and as a way to establish precedence. Many journals allow the posting of preprints, but some still do not; check the preprint policies of your journal before you submit.

    Publish in open access journals

    [Kara] It is possible to make your work more open even without using any of the tools described above if you make your final papers open access. Publishing in open access journals ("gold" open access) or self-archiving your manuscripts ("green" open access) lets a much wider audience, some of whom may be the taxpayers who funded your research, read your work.

[Kara, Luke, Chris, Bill, Corinna, Erin]
[Concluding paragraph]
[Open Science?] Online tools make possible a future in which not only scientific practice but also scientific culture are transformed by openness (Hey et al 2009, Nielsen 2011) from the sharing of nascent ideas that can be improved upon by active discussion, to the instantaneous upload of data at the moment of capture through open forum that leads to completion of research in products that may be viewed as "living papers". The archives of such information and process constitute the raw materials on which subsequent generations will actively build to push new frontiers in science and to evolve solutions to pressing societal problems. For many ecologists, such a future is exciting, but their present constraints - whether technological or cultural - may prevent the full realization of an open process; nevertheless, we can all move our science toward this future by adopting aspects of open science that are currently feasible for ourselves (e.g. publishing open access articles and data) and promoting skills in our students and junior colleagues that will best prepare them for the opportunities and rewards of practicing ecology in an open environment.
