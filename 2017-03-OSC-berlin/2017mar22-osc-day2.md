# [Open Educational Resources](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources): A Catalyst for Innovation in Education
Professor Dirk van Damme, Head of the Innovation and Measuring Progress Division (IMEP), OECD, France

+ MOOC'S are not openly licensed - not [OER](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_educational_resources).
+ 5 R's of OER
  + Retain
  + Reuse
  + Revise
  + Remix
  + Redistribute
+ Enabled by IP licensing like CC licenses

#### Benefits of OER
+ Open != Free
+ No impact in innovation in schools because of digitisation - content and teaching methods have to change.
+ Average handbook is better designed than a MOOC.
+ Read a paper by his colleague - ?

#### OER 
+ OER can help teachers collaborate on content - currently they are not collaborating.

# Report of the EC Expert Group on Metrics - Short presentations and panel discussion :  
    
## 1. Professor Judit Bar-Ilan, Department Information Science, Bar-Ilan University, Israel
    
#### Challenges
+ Gaming - done via citations
+ Acceptance : by Research community

Bibliometrics, Altmetics and Peer review is not about numbers - Qualitative Vs. Quantitaitive

#### REcommendations
+ https://ec.europa.eu/research/openscience/index.cfm?pg=altmetrics_eg

+ No perfect metrics : no single metric to measure openscience. There is always bias. 
+ Responsible use of metrics is key : qualtitative measurement must correspond with qualitative results, test and verify results, update indicators regularly. 
+ OpenScience require s openmetrics: owned by companies that dont allow us to scrutinize the data.
+ Measure what matters

## 3. Dr Dr René von Schomberg, A.6-Data, Open Access and Foresight, DG Research & Innovation, European Commission, 

## 4. Altmetrics: trends in research and ways to meet them! - Benedikt Fecher, German Institute for Economic Research (DIW Berlin) / Alexander von Humboldt Institute for Internet and Society, Germany

+ Faculty require the quantitative stats for citations, impact metrics and scores.
+ Impact scores should:: reflect research practice, Benefit the community abd able to tell attention and impact apart.
+ Questions : What about impact beyond the data?

# German Network for Educational Research Data Network – Building a research data infrastructure for educational studies in Germany. Alexia Meyermann, German Institute for International Educational Research (DIPF), Germany

+ Report: https://ec.europa.eu/research/openscience/index.cfm?pg=altmetrics_eg
+ Web: www.forschungsdaten-bildung.de
+ Email: verbund@forschungsdaten-bildung.de

+ Open Ed Data: 300 projects, only 144 gave a response.
+ EBF program needs incentive and compliance
+ data sharing should be treated as incentive to share.
+ Capabilities: need RDM skills.
+ In DE, researchers cannot ask for funding for RDM.
+ Q: How should the Research data infra look like?
   1. __deal with heterogeneous data types, methods and terminology__
   2. Privacy concerns : access is regulated in DE.
