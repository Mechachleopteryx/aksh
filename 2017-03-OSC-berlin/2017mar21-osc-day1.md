+ OSPP is also about RDM and resource management.
+ The hub will beconnected to the german education server


1. Plenary talks  - leading experts
2. Panel talk - OSPP is also about RDM and resource management.
3. Poster sessions - wanted to learn what people are doing in the field.

# Jean-Claude Burgelman: Next steps on the European Open Science cloud (EOSC)

+ OS Cloud - by 2020 
+ federate all data infrastructures, open and seamless no data locking,
+ EU cloud initiative - supported by DE ministry
+ 3 pillars: EOSC, EDI (european data infrastructure), widen access and buid trust
+ Policy: content (open data), 
    + ODatainfrastructure: Connect key EU RI, Action plan.
    + Governance: develop a roadmap, create a global level playing field, widen use if public services
+ HLEG EOSC report (110ct 2016)
    + publication of first report by commission of high level group.
+ Core functions of EOSC - 6 functions
  + standards
  + standard setting and certification: metadata, data must be FAIR.
  + data stewardship, tools
  + catalog of services
  + rules of engagement
  + agenda setting

#### Next practical steps
+ EOSC Summit : 12 June 2017  
+ Declaration of intent by 2017
+ Funding decision on EOSC in WP 2018-2020 for H2020 - oct 2017
+ roadmap for governance and funding
+ interim governance board for the EOSC - winter 2017
+ EOSC web application - spring 2018
+ Action plan for FAIR data interoperability - summer 2018.

#### EOSC pilot project
+ support the cimmission with the first phase in the development of the EOSC

#### roadmap for gocernance and funding
+ 4 layers - architechture,governance, funding m timeline
+ 

#### OS is more than EOSC
+ made Open Data default
+ publishing platform for FWP publication
+ OA publishing
+ Altmetrics
+ global approach - G7, G20, RSA

+ OpenScience Monitor - aggregator for all the science news: https://ec.europa.eu/research/openscience/index.cfm?pg=home&section=monitor

# 4. FAIR
+ Belgian professor
+ EOSC - first report and recommendations
+ https://vimeo.com/162062013
+ Lose 80% of the data that is created is lost for reuse.
+ Supplementary data is lost 
+ 90% of data is generated in last 2 years

#### Data storage
+ little finger can store 7 billion genomes.

#### Big Data
+ need data scientists
+ Infra Vs Estuary 
+ Reward system for scientific researchers must be robust.

#### FAIR Guiding principles for scientific data management and stewardship paper
+ http://www.nature.com/articles/sdata201618

#### EOSC scope
+ uniprot - ontology mapping resources
+ 5% of 50 billion euros in H2020
+ Open data is expensive
+ €180 per terabyte made storage terribly expensive.
+ Not Open, GO FAIR - Global Open FAIR
+ Go-FAIR, http://www.dtls.nl/go-fair

# Open Science needs federated infrastructures - Professor Arndt Bode, Leibniz Supercomputing Centre Munich, Germany

####  [GeRDI](http://www.gerdi-project.de/) - Generic RDI 
+ Vision : create an infrastructure to support open and interdisciplinary research.
+ Open Trusted Environment
+ http://www.gerdi-project.de/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/PM_Bewilligung_Gerdi_final_englisch.pdf

#### Leibniz super computing centre.
+ Computer center for all of Munich.

#### Code hosting
+ gitlab instance for code sharing
+ Super MUC
+ Linux clusters

#### open data challenge
+ different quality of data - security/ support/media/ interconnection / background and knowledge/ 
+ GeRDI is a federated approach (metadata, description of data)
+ findable, acessible, interoperable, reproducible
+ 

#### Support the data lifeccycle
+ raw and derived data

#### Involved research communities
+ 5 partners
