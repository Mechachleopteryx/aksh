# Dietmar Stalke (Title : “Only good data can challenge chemical concepts")

### what is good data
* challeng data and the hypothesis.
* dont brush data (dont fudge) 
* R(rim) is the important factor for low residual density 
+ bigger crystals will ruin your data
+ low temperature data gives you better reults - low temp (<45 kelvin) and high temp (>60K) conforms only differ byt he twisting of etyle bridge which freeses on low and is thermallay averaged above , hence the phase transition is dyamucand not static s]disorder
