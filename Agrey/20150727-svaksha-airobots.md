# 1. AI ROBOTS

### Abstract

The algorithms<sup>{01}</sup> that control artificially intelligent robots rely on critical assumptions, viz. the availability of a complete geometric model, either two-dimensional or three-dimensional, of the object to be manipulated. The algorithm input is a polygonal/polyhedral-model for selecting optimal force-closure contact locations, which is the starting point for grasp analysis and dexterous manipulation methods that are then optimized for the desired properties in terms of dexterity, equilibrium, stability, dynamic behavior.

# 2. HYPOTHESIS

The BMI ‘decoder’<sup>{02} 2013, Willet etal</sup> converts neural activity into motor commands, by estimating and decoding the hand position of the subject. Other variables, say, joint torques and muscle activations are also tabulated. The visual observation paradigm uses the subject's neural visual activity data to predict the state of the arm being observed by the subject {2007, Tkach etal} and the user’s desired arm state (DAS) from a recent history of the user’s neural activity <sup>{02} 2013, Willet etal</sup>.


### Observations

# 3. QUESTIONS

+ Is any data from the CP patient being collected? If yes, what kind of data - brain imaging data, robot/motor movements data, something else..?
   + When the child moves what part of the brain activity data is collected? 
   + Is this collated with the arm/leg/body movements? How? 
   + 
+ Is there any link between the [frontal lobe](http://www.medicaldaily.com/battle-waterloo-might-not-have-happened-if-it-wasnt-neurosurgeon-jean-massot-how-345600) (funtioning, processing, etc..) and CP? What role does this play in motor skills?
