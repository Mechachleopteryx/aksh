# 1. AI ROBOTS

### Abstract

The algorithms<sup>{1}</sup> that control artificially intelligent robots rely on critical assumptions, viz. the availability of a complete geometric model, either two-dimensional or three-dimensional, of the object to be manipulated. The algorithm input is a polygonal/polyhedral-model for selecting optimal force-closure contact locations, which is the starting point for grasp analysis and dexterous manipulation methods that are then optimized for the desired properties in terms of dexterity, equilibrium, stability, dynamic behavior.

# 3. QUESTIONS

+ Is any data from the CP patient being collected? If yes, what kind of data - brain imaging data, robot/motor movements data, something else..?
   + When the child moves what part of the brain activity data is collected? 
   + Is this collated with the arm/leg/body movements?
