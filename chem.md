1) Call from the NIH on "Big Data to Knowledge (BD2K) Advancing Biomedical Science Using Crowdsourcing and Interactive Digital Media"

http://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/rfa-files/RFA-CA-15-006.html

2) The NIH screen for known drugs showing promise vs Ebola, featuring John McKew

http://www.nature.com/emi/journal/v3/n12/full/emi201488a.html

3) Whole issue of Chem Rev on neglected disease drug discovery

http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/cr500546h

4) "The Drugs for Neglected Diseases initiative (DNDi) has been awarded US$ 10 million by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to develop new treatments for onchocerciasis (river blindness) and lymphatic filariasis (elephantiasis) - the first-ever USAID grant for neglected tropical disease research and development (R&D)."

5) Articles from NRDD in 2014 making claim that pharma R&D productivity is "on the comeback trail"

http://www.nature.com/nrd/journal/v13/n5/full/nrd4320.html

and that precompetitive research is important

http://www.nature.com/nrd/journal/v13/n2/full/nrd4230.html

and the state of UK academic drug discovery

http://www.nature.com/nrd/journal/v13/n1/full/nrd4200.html

and article on the proposed Human Vaccines Project

http://www.nature.com/nrd/journal/v14/n1/full/nrd4528.html

a feature/retrospective of [Bayer's Grants4Targets open innovation scheme](http://www.nature.com/nrd/journal/v14/n1/full/nrd3078-c2.html) and the possible use of ["delinkage" strategies in the funding of antibiotic drug discovery R&D](http://www.nature.com/nrd/journal/v13/n10/full/nrd4455.html) and an interesting recent postmortem on the results of Bayer donating compounds to external collaborators: ["Remarkably, the interactions within this compound-donation programme had a positive influence on the recipient's opinion of both pharmaceutical research in general and of Bayer in particular."](http://www.nature.com/nrd/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nrd4008-c1.html)

6) Proposal to extend drug patent lifetimes by a year and reinvest funds in e.g. the NIH :: http://www.nature.com/nrd/journal/v14/n2/full/nrd4454-c1.html
And as a counterpoint there was a WashPo article on ["Why patents are innovation's worst enemy"](http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/innovations/wp/2015/03/11/heres-why-patents-are-innovations-worst-enemy/)

7) Report from the Institute of Medicine on "Sharing Clinical Trial Data: Maximizing Benefits, Minimizing Risk":: http://www.iom.edu/Reports/2015/Sharing-Clinical-Trial-Data.aspx

8) [Thinklab](http://thinklab.com/participate) - an initiative that uses project funds to pay for contributions to open projects, an interesting idea fraught with risks that is worth exploring (my view)

9) A recent John Oliver piece on the practice of marketing to doctors :: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQZ2UeOTO3I
