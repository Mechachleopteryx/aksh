# Optimization and Big Data, Ezgi Eren, eeren@pros.com
+ Pricing nd Revenue Management
    - maximize , expected demand, limited inventory
    - car rental pricing and revenue management
    - competitor based pricing
        - how much more cheaper or expensive you are 
    - channel strategies (how they book thru orbiz or walkin)
    - fleet distribution
        - keping resource free
        - need more data to plan this


+ Problem complexity
- millions and billions of constaints and decision variables
  + product
      - location 
    - brand
    - car type
    - check out date
    - length of rental 
  + Channel (related to cust behaviour)  
    - booking channel
    - customer segment
    - booking horizon
    - price tier

+ Channel Strategy Optimization
- for each product --> assume a demand limit --. optimize acroiss channela --> increase demand limit

+ Reduced P&D Optimization

Outline
- problem space
    - 2 TB of data
    - avg write is 4 billion /day

2. high availability

    - HBase10070 and HDFS - region server - meta region server - client
    - Fixed above problem with backup secondary servers 
        - HDFS - 
    - 3 options 
        - HBase 12259 - hydrabase integration          
     - global zookeeper - Hbase 1 and 2 withreplication with two writers
     + Takeaways - keep multiple data centers.
     
3. high freequency
  - Fine tuning 
  - use data to set heuristics
  -
