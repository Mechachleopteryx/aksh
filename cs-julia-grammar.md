  +  It's not just a question of syntactic convenience or brevity.  There is a huge semantic benefit to using dots for broadcasting operations: they explicitly inform the compiler, at the syntax level, that a broadcast is intended.   We aren't exploiting it yet, but soon I'm hoping to have automated loop fusion for dotted broadcasts.
  +  In contrast, if you write "x ^ y", the compiler can't detect that you want a broadcast until quite late, if ever.  First, you have to know that x and y are vectors, which doesn't happen until compile-time after type-inference occurs (assuming the types are inferred correctly).   Second, ^(x::Vector, y::Vector) can literally be anything — the whole point of Julia's design is that functions like ^ are just ordinary functions implemented in Julia itself, with no special status in the compiler.   So, at compile time, once you figure out the types of x and y and know what ^ method to dispatch to, the compiler has to look "inside" the ^ function and figure out somehow that it is a broadcast.   The problem with that kind of compiler "magic" is that it tends to be quite brittle, and is easily confused by functions that aren't written in a very special style.
  +  Whereas if you write sin.(x).^y, the compiler knows at parse time that broadcast is intended, and can transform it at parse time to broadcast((x,y) -> sin(x)^y, x, y), i.e. a single fused loop, without knowing anything about the types of x and y or the functions sin and ^.   Again, this doesn't happen yet, but I'm hoping it will happen soon.  (And since this becomes a parse-time guarantee, rather than a compiler optimization that may or may not occur, you don't have to worry about purity and side effects: an expression like sin.(x).^y will be defined as the fused loop, so we don't have to check whether it is equivalent to the unfused loop.)
  + (The key feature that has opened up this possibility is that anonymous functions are now fast, so that broadcast(+, x, y) is now as fast as the specialized loop for .+ that we have now.)

# Functions
+ The Julian way to validate function arguments? https://www.reddit.com/r/Julia/comments/57e2gk/julian_way_of_validating_function_arguments/

one thing to note about julia is that you can put multiple functions in one file:

    square_and_mult_by_c(x, c) = c*x*x

    smc(X::AbstractVector, c) = [square_and_mult_by_c(x, c) for x in X]

Note the second function calls the first, but you can put both of these in the same disk file. Once loaded, you can also call either of these functions from the command line.

+ Functions can have more than one argument, so you can pass both `x` and `c` from one function to another. See the manual sections on default and keyword arguments.

do not try to use variables, that you have defined in one function within another function.

I would suggest the following approach, if you need to modify variables in multiple functions:

```
# if you need to modify multiple variables in multiple functions,
# define a data type that holds all your variables
type Data
    a::Number
    b::Number
    c::Number
end

# declaring data as [const](docs.julialang.org/en/latest/stdlib/constants) has the main meaning, that the type stays the same,
# you CAN change the values of the fields later
const data = Data(1,2,3)

# pass an instance of the type Data to your function
function test1(dat, x, y)
    dat.a*x + dat.b*y
end

# to a second function, pass the same variable
function test2(dat, x1, y1)
    # you can change the value of the fields in the function
    dat.a += 1
    dat.b *= 2
    dat.a^x1 + dat.b^y1
end

x = 1.0
y = 3.0

println(test1(data, x, y))
println(data.a, " ", data.b)

println()
println(test2(data, x, y))
println(data.a, " ", data.b)
```

If you want to define your function in different files, that put the type definition in a third file and include
this file in both files, that define your functions.

# MACRO

### A macro to avoid END
Tom Short <tshort.rlists@gmail.com> wrote a quick macro for one-line if statements:
```
macro when(condition, expr)
    esc(:( if $condition; $expr; end))
end
```

```
julia>@when 4 > pi  x = 2
```

For even more compact syntax, you can replace `when` with `?`.


### @everywhere
@everywhere id = myid() 
remotecall_fetch(2, ()->id)  # The @everywhere macro executes a statement on all running processes.

# OOP

Julia is not an OOP language.

### Inheritance
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/julia-dev/eA4VkFAD-yQ
 
### Looping Vs. OOP in Julia

One doesn't always need to write the loops oneself. Oftentimes switching from a pure operator (e.g. broadcast) to its in-place counterpart (e.g. broadcast!) can make a world of difference:

julia> A = rand(5_000_000);

julia> function f(A)
    sum(A .+ A.^2)
end
f (generic function with 1 method)

julia> f(A); @time f(A)
0.182246 seconds (206 allocations: 76.307 MB, 5.70% gc time)
4.166856979458311e6


julia> _g(x, y) = x + y^2
_g (generic function with 1 method)

julia> function g(A)
    temp = Array(Float64,5_000_000)
    broadcast!(_g, temp, A, A)
    sum(temp)
end
g (generic function with 1 method)

julia> g(A); @time g(A)
0.023660 seconds (8 allocations: 38.147 MB, 28.73% gc time)
4.166856979458311e6

Thus it may help to cultivate knowledgeable use of map! and broadcast! as opposed to pure broadcasted operators

# RANGES

1) Why are there so many Range types? There is a UnitRange (start, stop),  a StepRange (start, step, stop), and a FloatRange(start, step, length, divisor), but I don't really understand why you can't just use the StepRange for everything. Maybe I'm just missing some obvious use cases, but this seems to lead to inconsistent or confusing behaviour like the 1 in my second question.

2) `findin` seems to have inconsistent behaviour for ranges depending on types in the ranges. `findin(::UnitRange, ::UnitRange)` returns another UnitRange, but `findin(::StepRange, ::StepRange)` returns an array of the indices. Is there some reason that these shouldn't be consistent?

Ex:
```
julia> findin(1:10, 2:5)
2:5

julia> findin(1:1:10, 2:2:5)
2-element Array{Int64,1}:
 2
 4

julia> r1 = DateTime(now())-Dates.Day(60):DateTime(now())
2015-08-22T19:07:47:1 day:2015-10-21T19:07:47

julia> r2 = r1[1:20]
2015-08-22T19:07:47:1 day:2015-09-10T19:07:47

> I don't really understand why you can't just use the StepRange for everything

You could. However, you can be more efficient by having special types (e.g. with UnitRange you don't need to check the steps).

>  `findin(::UnitRange, ::UnitRange)` returns another UnitRange

This seems good.

> `findin(::StepRange, ::StepRange)` returns an array of the indices

You might be able to do some maths here to return a StepRange... at least for Integers:

function Base.findin{T <: Integer}(a::StepRange{T}, b::StepRange{T})
    start = ??
    step = b.step ÷ gcd(a.step, b.step)
    stop = max(a.stop, b.stop)
    start:step:stop
end

but I 'm not sure this is possible with floats...

Looking in the source mentioning UnitRange here's a more serious bug: https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/e16c6784e1ba6f24b6faf0d282c78d8c14a1fbb3/base/array.jl#L866


julia> findin([5.2, 3.3], 3:20)
2-element Array{Int64,1}:
 1
 2

julia> findin([5.2, 3.3], 3:1:20)
0-element Array{Int64,1}

# Julia [Style Guide](http://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/manual/style-guide/)

### Python, if __name__ == '__main__':
+ https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/julia-users/ufpi8tV7sk8/-Uv0rtAWTWsJ

In Julia, files are either code to be loaded by something else or code to run. Python likes to mix the two with that idiom as a quick-and-dirty form of unit testing. Python also requires '__main__' when utilizing multiprocessing (http://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.html), presumably so child processes can load global code without getting caught in infinite recursions.
That is an anti-pattern in Julia, where you would just make a separate file full of ´@assert´ macros. See the [style guide](http://docs.julialang.org/en/latest/manual/style-guide/).
