# Functions
one thing to note about julia is that you can put multiple functions in one file:

    square_and_mult_by_c(x, c) = c*x*x

    smc(X::AbstractVector, c) = [square_and_mult_by_c(x, c) for x in X]

Note the second function calls the first, but you can put both of these in the same disk file. Once loaded, you can also call either of these functions from the command line.

+ Functions can have more than one argument, so you can pass both `x` and `c` from one function to another. See the manual sections on default and keyword arguments.

do not try to use variables, that you have defined in one function within another function.

I would suggest the following approach, if you need to modify variables in multiple functions:

```
# if you need to modify multiple variables in multiple functions,
# define a data type that holds all your variables
type Data
    a::Number
    b::Number
    c::Number
end

# declaring data as const has the main meaning, that the type stays the same,
# you CAN change the values of the fields later
const data = Data(1,2,3)

# pass an instance of the type Data to your function
function test1(dat, x, y)
    dat.a*x + dat.b*y
end

# to a second function, pass the same variable
function test2(dat, x1, y1)
    # you can change the value of the fields in the function
    dat.a += 1
    dat.b *= 2
    dat.a^x1 + dat.b^y1
end

x = 1.0
y = 3.0

println(test1(data, x, y))
println(data.a, " ", data.b)

println()
println(test2(data, x, y))
println(data.a, " ", data.b)
```

If you want to define your function in different files, that put the type definition in a third file and include
this file in both files, that define your functions.

# OOP

Julia is not an OOP language.

### Inheritance

### Looping Vs. OOP in Julia

One doesn't always need to write the loops oneself. Oftentimes switching from a pure operator (e.g. broadcast) to its in-place counterpart (e.g. broadcast!) can make a world of difference:

julia> A = rand(5_000_000);

julia> function f(A)
    sum(A .+ A.^2)
end
f (generic function with 1 method)

julia> f(A); @time f(A)
0.182246 seconds (206 allocations: 76.307 MB, 5.70% gc time)
4.166856979458311e6


julia> _g(x, y) = x + y^2
_g (generic function with 1 method)

julia> function g(A)
    temp = Array(Float64,5_000_000)
    broadcast!(_g, temp, A, A)
    sum(temp)
end
g (generic function with 1 method)

julia> g(A); @time g(A)
0.023660 seconds (8 allocations: 38.147 MB, 28.73% gc time)
4.166856979458311e6

Thus it may help to cultivate knowledgeable use of map! and broadcast! as opposed to pure broadcasted operators

# RANGES

1) Why are there so many Range types? There is a UnitRange (start, stop),  a StepRange (start, step, stop), and a FloatRange(start, step, length, divisor), but I don't really understand why you can't just use the StepRange for everything. Maybe I'm just missing some obvious use cases, but this seems to lead to inconsistent or confusing behaviour like the 1 in my second question.

2) `findin` seems to have inconsistent behaviour for ranges depending on types in the ranges. `findin(::UnitRange, ::UnitRange)` returns another UnitRange, but `findin(::StepRange, ::StepRange)` returns an array of the indices. Is there some reason that these shouldn't be consistent?

Ex:
```
julia> findin(1:10, 2:5)
2:5

julia> findin(1:1:10, 2:2:5)
2-element Array{Int64,1}:
 2
 4

julia> r1 = DateTime(now())-Dates.Day(60):DateTime(now())
2015-08-22T19:07:47:1 day:2015-10-21T19:07:47

julia> r2 = r1[1:20]
2015-08-22T19:07:47:1 day:2015-09-10T19:07:47

You could. However, you can be more efficient by having special types (e.g. with UnitRange you don't need to check the steps).

>  `findin(::UnitRange, ::UnitRange)` returns another UnitRange

This seems good.

> `findin(::StepRange, ::StepRange)` returns an array of the indices

You might be able to do some maths here to return a StepRange... at least for Integers:

function Base.findin{T <: Integer}(a::StepRange{T}, b::StepRange{T})
    start = ??
    step = b.step รท gcd(a.step, b.step)
    stop = max(a.stop, b.stop)
    start:step:stop
end

but I 'm not sure this is possible with floats...

Looking in the source mentioning UnitRange here's a more serious bug: https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/blob/e16c6784e1ba6f24b6faf0d282c78d8c14a1fbb3/base/array.jl#L866


julia> findin([5.2, 3.3], 3:20)
2-element Array{Int64,1}:
 1
 2

julia> findin([5.2, 3.3], 3:1:20)
0-element Array{Int64,1}
