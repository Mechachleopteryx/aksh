# L2 – Piero Macchi “General Aspects of Multipole Modelling”

# Multipolar Expansion 
* ED is expanded in mytiplar centered atomic functions 

P is the unknown value
rho is the fitting model
two kind of functions - radial part and angular part

### Choice of radial function  

GAussian or Slater functions are used fir ht angular behaviour of Rho to he finite in origin/.

### Core orbitals 
* are a combination of slate functions and when you take a square of the function you get the 
* spherical valence calculation 


# Which wave function for core and valence
* Roothan-Hartree-Fock calculation on ground state isolated atoms and more relevant ions. Each atonic orbital is expanded in a series of Slater functions 


## Relativistic atomic wave funtions 

* Zero order RElativisti approximation  DFT calculation on isolated atoms 
* Scattering factor efrrors with respect to te dirac equation

## Deformation valence density (DEFV)
* a single slater function will be used for the seta exponet constructed from the single valence orbitals
* Satisfy a poisson equation for radial equation the N has to be larger
* Valence and core fraction are the largest near the core - to refine the core, then resolution is higher but not from the valence

## D orbitals of transition metals - ex 3d orbitals of Fe
* Full orbital expansion in the slater function

### 3d/4s orbital of transition metals
* CLose in energy abd far in space

### Angular functions and spherical harmonics

Orbitals vs. multipoles
* linesr combination of sperical harmonics 
the xpansion goes maximum for product of two L + L' (l prime) = that mean an approdimation of linear combination of atoms centered - add the odd and even electronic density

## Fitting the density of H2
* fitting with monopolar functions - but will have spherical atoms with overlap density. 
* Expand diagonal dipoles but it will not answer
* We need dipoles and quadripolar functions to fit the density of two Hydrogen atoms

## d-orbitals and metal atoms
* make and assumption that the d-orbital and othe atom does not overlap and it allows to get the refinement
* Hexadecapole refinement - no overlap among carbon atoms
* dipoles and octopoles are very small and only describe 3d product.
* TRy refining 3s occupation

# Multipolar expansions in the Periodic table - summary
* H cannot be described a s monpole
* alkaline and noble gases can be described by spherical functions
* Hexa/Deca to octapole level or more for lower elements 
* 

* Mirror Symmetry will force you to reduce the 3m symmetry implying a distorted hybridization models.
