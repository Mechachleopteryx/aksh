# H-atoms

* Hydrogen and xrays - in standard xray crystal structure determination, thermal mption is deconvoluted from electronic effects by application of hte Born-Oppenheimer approximation

+ atomic pdf can be isotropic or anisotropic - H does not have core electrons. 

## Hydrogen bonding (HB)
* H atom is bonded to a more electronegative atom, the donor atom
* the positive hydrogen is attracted to negative H partners
a. normal and weak HB with double well bonding
b.
c.

* Resonance is non-H structure - with neg or pos charge
* 

1. Use neutron data to obtain unbiased position and adps
2. obtain anisitropic Hatom adp by TLS analysus if the non Hskeleton and internal vibrational amplitude
3. Hrishfeld 

## How to combine X and N (utron) data
* Grow the crystal - really hard


### SCaling - UIJXN program
* systematic 

### HB Characterization
* module XDPROP can be used to calculate the laplacian distrributuobn - used to studey the nature of the chemical bonding in the hydrogen bond.
* Density and laplacian along the O...H bond is interesting 
 
### Bond energies
* empirically corelate the toological propertios of the HB bcp
