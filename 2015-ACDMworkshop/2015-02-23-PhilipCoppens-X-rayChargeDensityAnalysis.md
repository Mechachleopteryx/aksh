# L1 – Philip Coppens “A Birds Eye Introduction to X-ray Charge Density
Analysis and Some Recent Developments”

# Basic principals of X-Ray charge dnsities analysis and an intro to excitation densities

* AToms in a mol or crystal are not  spherical 
** The exprimental xray charge density minus the charge density of spherical atoms centred at the neutron positions with neutron parameters 

** set of nuclear co-ord and detailed map of electron distriibution

### Multipoles definition if pseudoatoms
* pseuroatom is not so much an atom but something that takes the bonding density of molecules


# Definitions
* Multipoles are a complete set of angular functions and the higher you go the more object sets you can represent.
* Niels Hansens theory - Charge density refinement program MOLLY, precursor of XD program
* Density functions looks like orbitals

* Modifications of pseudoatoms cannot be rigid because of electron-electron repulsion. Atoms that are positive then the same charge density will occur for the same chage density

### X-Ray charge density multipole model
* Static electon Density is the super position of aspherical pseudoatoms
* Formalism for high order data can show core expansion and contraction of coredeformations

### Diff between cd-mulltipoles and atomic orbitals
* Spherical Harmonic basis functions 
* Normalization of spherical harmonoc orbival func needs different normaization of density technique

### Electron density in terms of obitals
* ONE-electron  density - diagonal, atom-centered terms and cross terms, including 2 center terms 
* DEnsity functions are products of orbital functions - Y10.Y01 =y21


### //ed in terms of orbitals 
* Mathematical corelation between multipole polulations and orbital populations if 2 center terms are neglected 


# Total density 


# Results
* DEformation density from multipole refinement
1. dynamic and static function plots of *Static* total density. 

CONCEPTS: 
+ Bond paths
+ Bond critical paths
+ atomic basinsan
* Laplacian : charge concentrations - if the peak is big second order derivative is big

An atomic charge is not an atomic charge


### Analysis if the toploly of charge density - quantum theory

# Charge density and structural dynamics
*  Define excitation densities :  a laser pump xray probe technique with the BioCARS hutch at APS Argonne
* Def of Activation difference map: Charge density is hard to discern but the method tcalculate the ES (excited state) geometry on GS (ground state) 
 Structure and subtract grids
*  Coinage metal compound Ag2Cu2L1
