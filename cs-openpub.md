# OpenPublications
+ A peer-reviewed publication path for software that is not necessarily scientifically novel. 
+ In statistics there is the Journal of Statistical Software.
+ In neuroscience/imaging there are things like the Insight Journal and the "Frontiers in..." imprints which have software-specific tracks.
+ [Computer Physics Communications](http://www.journals.elsevier.com/computer-physics-communications/) publishes a lot of articles and papers that are more intended to document free/open-source implementations than they are to describe novel algorithms. This is quite useful as a way to give people something to cite when they use your code, and also to obtain more traditional academic credit for free-software work.
+ Stata and R have their own journals: [Stata Journal](http://www.stata-journal.com/) and [R Journal](https://journal.r-project.org/).
